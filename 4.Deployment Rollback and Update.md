# We have deployed a simple web application. Inspect the PODs and the Services



Wait for the application to fully deploy and view the application using the link called Webapp Portal above your terminal.

# What container image is used to deploy the applications?

Run the command kubectl describe deployment and look for Images

# If you were to upgrade the application now what would happen?

Few only upgrade at a time

# Let us try that. Upgrade the application by setting the image on the deployment to kodekloud/webapp-color:v2


Do not delete and re-create the deployment. Only set the new image name for the existing deployment.


Deployment Name: frontend

Deployment Image: kodekloud/webapp-color:v2
### solution 1



```kubectl set image deploy frontend simple-webapp=kodekloud/webapp-color:v2```


The `kubectl set image` command is used to update the container image of one or more containers in a running Deployment, StatefulSet, or ReplicaSet in a Kubernetes cluster. The specific command you provided, `kubectl set image deploy frontend simple-webapp=kodekloud/webapp-color:v2`, is used to update the image of a container named "simple-webapp" in a Deployment named "frontend."

Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `kubectl`: This is the command-line tool for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster.

- `set image`: This is the subcommand used to update container images.

- `deploy frontend`: This part of the command specifies the resource you want to update, which is a Deployment named "frontend."

- `simple-webapp=kodekloud/webapp-color:v2`: This part of the command specifies the container name "simple-webapp" within the Deployment and the new container image "kodekloud/webapp-color:v2" that you want to use.

When you run this command, Kubernetes will perform the following actions:

1. It will locate the "frontend" Deployment.
2. Within the Deployment, it will identify the container named "simple-webapp."
3. It will update the image of the "simple-webapp" container to "kodekloud/webapp-color:v2."

This command is especially useful for performing rolling updates to your application. Kubernetes will manage the update process, ensuring that the new image is gradually rolled out to the pods in your Deployment while maintaining a specified number of old pods until the rollout is complete. This ensures that your application remains available during the update process.

In summary, the `kubectl set image` command is a convenient way to update container images in a Kubernetes Deployment or similar workload resource without the need to manually edit the YAML configuration.





### solution 2
Run the command `kubectl edit deployment frontend` and modify the image to `kodekloud/webapp-color:v2`.
Next, save and exit. The pods should be recreated with the new image.

# Up to how many PODs can be down for upgrade at a time


Consider the current strategy settings and number of PODs - 4

### Look at the Max Unavailable value under RollingUpdateStrategy in deployment details

# Change the deployment strategy to Recreate

Delete and re-create the deployment if necessary. Only update the strategy type for the existing deployment.
