# A Pod is one of the fundamental building blocks in Kubernetes. It's the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model and is used to run a single instance of a containerized application. Understanding Pods is essential for beginners in Kubernetes. Here's an explanation of Pods:

**1. Basic Unit of Deployment:**
   - A Pod represents a single instance of a running process in a Kubernetes cluster. This process is typically a single container, although it can be multiple containers tightly coupled and sharing resources.

**2. Encapsulation:**
   - Containers within a Pod share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other using `localhost`. They can also share storage volumes, making it easy for them to interact and share data.

**3. Why Pods?:**
   - Pods are a level of abstraction that helps manage and orchestrate containers. They allow you to group related containers and resources together, which is particularly useful when containers within a Pod need to communicate with each other.

**4. Lifespan:**
   - Pods are mortal; they have a finite lifespan. They are created, run for a period of time, and then terminated. When a Pod is terminated, it can be replaced by a new one, typically under the control of a higher-level controller like a Deployment or StatefulSet.

**5. Use Cases:**
   - Pods are used for various purposes, including running web servers, databases, application servers, monitoring agents, or any other type of application. For example, a web application might consist of a frontend and a backend container, both of which run within the same Pod.

**6. Labels and Selectors:**
   - Pods can be labeled with key-value pairs, and you can use selectors to group and manage Pods with similar labels. This allows you to apply services, deployments, and other higher-level Kubernetes resources to specific sets of Pods.

**7. Networking:**
   - Each Pod in a Kubernetes cluster has a unique IP address. Containers within the same Pod can communicate using `localhost`, while containers in different Pods can communicate over the network.

**8. Scaling:**
   - When you need to scale your application, you typically do it by managing the number of Pods. Higher-level controllers like Deployments or StatefulSets create and manage multiple Pods as needed, ensuring high availability and load balancing.

**9. Resource Management:**
   - Pods can be allocated CPU and memory resources, which can be used for resource management and scheduling by the Kubernetes system.

In summary, a Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, encapsulating one or more containers and shared resources. Understanding and effectively managing Pods is crucial for deploying and running containerized applications in a Kubernetes cluster.

Use the kubectl run command with the correct image.

```ruby
controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl run nginx --image=nginx
pod/nginx created

controlplane ~ ➜  kubectl get pods
NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx   1/1     Running   0          13s
```
The command `kubectl run nginx --image=nginx` is used in the context of Kubernetes, a popular container orchestration platform, to create and deploy a containerized application.

Here's a breakdown of the command:

1. `kubectl`: This is the command-line tool for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to manage and control various aspects of your Kubernetes environment.

2. `run`: This is a subcommand of `kubectl` that is used to create and manage resources in a Kubernetes cluster. In this case, it's used to create a new deployment or pod.

3. `nginx`: This is the name given to the resource you're creating. In this context, it represents the name of the deployment or pod that will be created. You can choose any name you like for your resource.

4. `--image=nginx`: This is a flag that specifies the container image to use for the deployment or pod named "nginx." In this example, it's using the official NGINX container image, which is publicly available on Docker Hub. This flag tells Kubernetes to create a deployment or pod running the NGINX web server.

So, when you run the command `kubectl run nginx --image=nginx`, Kubernetes will create a deployment or pod named "nginx" and run the NGINX container within it. This will make the NGINX web server accessible within your Kubernetes cluster. You can then further configure and manage this deployment using other Kubernetes commands and resources.


# What is the image used to create the new pods?

# Which nodes are these pods placed on?


You must look at all the pods in detail to figure this out.

Run the command `kubectl describe pod newpods-<id>` and look at the `node` field.
Alternatively run `kubectl get pods -o wide` and check for the node the pod is placed on.

# Create a new pod with the name redis and the image redis123.


Use a pod-definition YAML file. And yes the image name is wrong!


Name: redis

Image name: redis123

We use kubectl run command with `--dry-run=client -o yaml` option to create a manifest file :-
### `kubectl run redis --image=redis123 --dry-run=client -o yaml > redis-definition.yaml`
The command `kubectl run redis --image=redis123 --dry-run=client -o yaml > redis-definition.yaml` is used to generate a Kubernetes resource definition in YAML format for a Redis deployment without actually creating the deployment in the cluster. Here's a breakdown of the command:

1. `kubectl`: This is the command-line tool for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster.

2. `run`: This is a subcommand of `kubectl` that is used to create and manage resources in a Kubernetes cluster, including deploying applications.

3. `redis`: This is the name you're giving to the resource you're creating. In this context, it represents the name of the deployment that will be generated.

4. `--image=redis123`: This flag specifies the container image to use for the deployment. It tells Kubernetes to use the "redis123" container image when creating the resource. However, please note that "redis123" is not an official Redis image, and you should replace it with a valid Redis image name if you intend to use a real Redis image.

5. `--dry-run=client`: This flag is used to simulate creating the resource without actually applying it to the cluster. In this "client" mode, the command checks for errors in the resource specification without making any changes to the cluster.

6. `-o yaml`: This flag specifies the output format for the generated resource. In this case, it's set to YAML, which means the result will be a YAML-formatted resource definition.

7. `> redis-definition.yaml`: This part of the command redirects the output to a file named "redis-definition.yaml." The YAML representation of the resource will be saved to this file.

So, when you run the command, it will generate a Kubernetes resource definition for a Redis deployment using the specified container image ("redis123"), but it won't actually create the deployment in the cluster. Instead, it will save the resource definition in a YAML file named "redis-definition.yaml" for further inspection or potential modification before applying it to the Kubernetes cluster at a later time.


After that, using `kubectl create -f` command to create a resource from the manifest file :-

### `kubectl create -f redis-definition.yaml`
The command `kubectl create -f redis-definition.yaml` is used to create or apply Kubernetes resources defined in a YAML file (in this case, "redis-definition.yaml") to a Kubernetes cluster. Here's a breakdown of the command:

1. `kubectl`: This is the command-line tool for interacting with a Kubernetes cluster.

2. `create`: This is a subcommand of `kubectl` that is used to create or apply resources in a Kubernetes cluster. It can be used to create or update various types of resources, such as deployments, pods, services, and more.

3. `-f redis-definition.yaml`: This part of the command specifies the file containing the resource definitions you want to apply to the cluster. In this case, "redis-definition.yaml" is the YAML file that contains the configuration for a Redis deployment (or any other Kubernetes resource). Kubernetes will read the contents of this file and create or update resources in the cluster based on the definitions provided.

So, when you run the command `kubectl create -f redis-definition.yaml`, Kubernetes will read the "redis-definition.yaml" file and create the Kubernetes resource(s) defined in that file. This allows you to deploy and manage applications and infrastructure in your Kubernetes cluster based on the configurations specified in the YAML file.

Keep in mind that this command can be used to create or update various types of Kubernetes resources, depending on what is defined in the YAML file. The specific resource type and behavior are determined by the content of the YAML file.


Verify the work by running kubectl get command :-

`kubectl get pods`

# Now change the image on this pod to redis.


Once done, the pod should be in a running state.

CheckCompleteIncomplete
Name: redis

Image name: redis

Use the kubectl edit command to update the image of the pod to redis.

kubectl edit pod redis
If you used a pod definition file then update the image from redis123 to redis in the definition file via Vi or Nano editor and then run kubectl apply command to update the image :-

kubectl apply -f redis-definition.yaml 

![Screenshot from 2023-10-24 07-20-50](https://github.com/Althaf-official/KodeKloud_Kubernetes/assets/105126131/3c4c97ef-8fc6-4e4a-b7b0-72b50b0b3419)


`kubectl edit pod redis` and `kubectl apply -f redis-definition.yaml` are both commands used in the Kubernetes ecosystem to manage pods and other resources. Let me explain each of them in more detail:

1. `kubectl edit pod redis`:
   - This command is used to edit an existing Kubernetes pod named "redis" directly in your default text editor (usually specified by the `EDITOR` environment variable). If the pod doesn't exist, it will create a new one.
   - When you run this command, Kubernetes will open the YAML configuration of the "redis" pod in the specified text editor, and you can make changes to it.
   - After you've made your edits and saved the file, Kubernetes will apply those changes to the pod. This is a quick way to make modifications to a running pod's configuration without manually deleting and recreating the pod.
   - The pod's configuration is stored in a YAML file that describes its properties, such as the image, environment variables, resource requests, and more.

2. `kubectl apply -f redis-definition.yaml`:
   - This command is used to create or update Kubernetes resources based on a configuration file specified by the `-f` flag. In this case, it's trying to create or update a resource using the configuration defined in the "redis-definition.yaml" file.
   - The YAML file, "redis-definition.yaml," typically contains a specification for a Kubernetes resource, such as a pod, deployment, service, or other objects. The content of the file defines the desired state of the resource.
   - If the resource described in the YAML file doesn't exist, `kubectl apply` will create it. If the resource already exists, `kubectl apply` will update the resource to match the desired state as defined in the YAML file.
   - This is a common way to manage and deploy applications in Kubernetes because it allows you to declaratively specify the desired state of your resources, making it easier to manage configurations and updates.

In summary, `kubectl edit pod redis` allows you to interactively edit the configuration of an existing pod, while `kubectl apply -f redis-definition.yaml` is used to create or update Kubernetes resources based on the configuration defined in a YAML file. Both commands are important tools for managing and configuring Kubernetes resources.
