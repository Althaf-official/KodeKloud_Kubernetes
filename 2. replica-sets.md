# How many PODs exist on the system?
`kubectl get pods`

# How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?


Run the command: `kubectl get replicaset` or `kubectl get rs` and count the number of ReplicaSets.

# What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set?

# Why do you think the PODs are not ready?

The image BUSYBOX777 doesn't exist

# Delete any one of the 4 PODs.

# Why are there still 4 PODs, even after you deleted one?

### `ReplicaSet ensures that desired number of PODs always run`


# Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/.

check the replicaset yaml file

There is an issue with the file, so try to fix it.

# Fix the issue in the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file and create a ReplicaSet using it.


This file is located at /root/.

# Delete the two newly created ReplicaSets - replicaset-1 and replicaset-2

Run the command: kubectl delete replicaset <replicaset-name> or kubectl delete -f <file-name>.yaml

# Fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image.


Either delete and recreate the ReplicaSet or Update the existing ReplicaSet and then delete all PODs, so new ones with the correct image will be created.

update and delete old pods. replica set will automatically create new pods

# Scale the ReplicaSet to 5 PODs.


Use kubectl scale command or edit the replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.

# Now scale the ReplicaSet down to 2 PODs.


Use the kubectl scale command or edit the replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.

### Run the command: `kubectl edit replicaset new-replica-set`, modify the replicas and then save the file OR run: `kubectl scale rs new-replica-set --replicas=2` to scale down to 2 PODs.
