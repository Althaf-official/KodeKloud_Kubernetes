# what a ReplicaSet is in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, a ReplicaSet is a resource that helps ensure that a specified number of identical pods (replicas) are running at all times. It's a simple way to achieve high availability and reliability for your applications.

Here are some key points to understand about ReplicaSets:

1. **Desired Replicas:** When you create a ReplicaSet, you specify the number of replicas (pods) that you want to run. This is known as the "desired replica count." The ReplicaSet's job is to make sure this many replicas are always running.

2. **Pod Template:** To create replicas, a ReplicaSet uses a template for creating pods. This template defines what the pods should look like, including the container image, resources, labels, and other configuration.

3. **Selectors:** A ReplicaSet uses labels to select the pods it should manage. The labels in the ReplicaSet's selector match the labels in the pods' metadata. This way, it knows which pods it is responsible for.

4. **Automatic Scaling:** If a pod managed by a ReplicaSet fails or is deleted, the ReplicaSet automatically creates a new one to maintain the desired replica count. This ensures that your application remains available.

5. **Manual Scaling:** You can manually scale a ReplicaSet by changing its desired replica count. This allows you to add or remove replicas based on your application's needs.

6. **Version Control:** ReplicaSets are a way to manage different versions of your application. You can use them to perform rolling updates or rollbacks without downtime.

Here's an example to illustrate how a ReplicaSet works:

Suppose you have a web application, and you want to ensure that there are always three identical pods running to handle incoming web traffic. You create a ReplicaSet with a desired replica count of 3. You specify a pod template that includes the web server container image, necessary resources, and labels. The ReplicaSet monitors the pods it created, and if one pod goes down for any reason, it automatically replaces it with a new one. This ensures that you always have three healthy pods serving your application.

In summary, a ReplicaSet is a fundamental building block in Kubernetes for ensuring that a specific number of identical pods are always available, which is essential for maintaining the reliability and availability of your applications.

# How many PODs exist on the system?
`kubectl get pods`

# How many ReplicaSets exist on the system?


Run the command: `kubectl get replicaset` or `kubectl get rs` and count the number of ReplicaSets.

# What is the image used to create the pods in the new-replica-set?

# Why do you think the PODs are not ready?

The image BUSYBOX777 doesn't exist

# Delete any one of the 4 PODs.

# How many PODs exist now?
4

# Why are there still 4 PODs, even after you deleted one?

### `ReplicaSet ensures that desired number of PODs always run`


# Create a ReplicaSet using the replicaset-definition-1.yaml file located at /root/.

check the replicaset yaml file

There is an issue with the file, so try to fix it.

Name: replicaset-1

# Fix the issue in the replicaset-definition-2.yaml file and create a ReplicaSet using it.


This file is located at /root/.

# Delete the two newly created ReplicaSets - replicaset-1 and replicaset-2

Run the command: kubectl delete replicaset <replicaset-name> or kubectl delete -f <file-name>.yaml

# Fix the original replica set new-replica-set to use the correct busybox image.


Either delete and recreate the ReplicaSet or Update the existing ReplicaSet and then delete all PODs, so new ones with the correct image will be created.

update and delete old pods. replica set will automatically create new pods

# Scale the ReplicaSet to 5 PODs.


Use kubectl scale command or edit the replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.

# Now scale the ReplicaSet down to 2 PODs.


Use the kubectl scale command or edit the replicaset using kubectl edit replicaset.

### Run the command: `kubectl edit replicaset new-replica-set`, modify the replicas and then save the file OR run: `kubectl scale rs new-replica-set --replicas=2` to scale down to 2 PODs.
